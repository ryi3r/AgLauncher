# Another game Launcher (AgL)

While still being a big W.I.P, AgL will provide support for G.I, H.S.R, Z.Z.Z, and soon H.I.3 (when the company behind it enables the protocol being used in the other games)
The games mentioned have at least an implementation to download the game.

So far, G.I and Z.Z.Z work normally, do not launch H.S.R through this launcher yet.

## DO NOT USE THIS LAUNCHER YET, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED

As of writing this, no games are supported to being downloaded or launched yet, but their implementations are there.
The China/BiliBili region is not yet supported, as I have no idea how they work completly yet.

I also plan on adding support for W.U.W.A, but no investigation nor code toward it has been made just yet.

## Contributing

You may contribute as long as you're being nice to people.

## Compilation

You need Godot (Mono / C#) 4.4.1 and .NET CORE 9 to be able to run the project, other versions may run the project but they are untested.

## Safety

The safety of your account(s) is not guaranteed, use at your own caution.

## Reporting Issues

You should report issues that block the launcher's normal functionality (such as downloading a game), or to suggest features.
Keep in mind you *can* suggest to add other games but it's very unlikely they will get added unless there's a proof-of-concept for downloading, repairing and playing the game.

## Credits

Big thanks to the Linux community that's helping towards making these launchers (and of course with my silly launcher...)
They mean a lot to the community of these games that's trying to move away from Windows.

Either way, the following people/teams deserve credits for even letting me get here:

An Anime Team, Krock and mkrsym1.
Y'all are amazing!
